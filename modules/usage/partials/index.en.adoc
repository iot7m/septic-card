You can control your *IoT7m* smart home using popular voice assistants such as *Yandex Alice*, *Google Assistant*, and *Apple Siri*.

This allows you to turn devices on or off, run automation scenarios (e.g., "Good morning", "I’m away"), and get spoken updates about your home’s status.

The system is based on *Home Assistant*, so voice control works through cloud integrations or local gateways.
