This section describes how to install *GSeptik Card* in *Home Assistant*.

The card is distributed as a custom frontend component and is connected to the Home Assistant interface via Lovelace resources.

== HACS installation

Support for installation via *Home Assistant Community Store (HACS)* is currently under development and not yet available.

Manual installation is recommended.

== Manual installation

For manual installation, download the card file and add it to the Home Assistant resources.

First, download the latest `gseptik-card.js` file from the project releases page and copy it to the Home Assistant directory:

```
/config/www/gseptik/gseptik-card.js
```

After that, add the card as a resource using one of the methods described below.

=== Adding the resource via the UI

1. Go to *Settings* → *Dashboards* → *Resources*.
2. Click *Add Resource*.
3. Set the file path to:
`/local/gseptik/gseptik-card.js`
4. Select *JavaScript Module* as the resource type.

=== Adding the resource via YAML

Add the resource to your Lovelace configuration:

```yaml
resources:
  - url: /local/gseptik/gseptik-card.js
    type: module
```

After adding the resource, refresh the browser page or clear the cache if the card does not appear immediately.

Once installed, the card becomes available for adding to Home Assistant dashboards.
