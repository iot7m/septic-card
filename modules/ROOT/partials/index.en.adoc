:navtitle:  Overview

The *IoT7m* smart home system is a comprehensive solution for automating and remotely managing household devices. At the core of the ecosystem is the *Home Assistant* platform, running locally or in the cloud, with a focus on security, flexibility, and autonomy.

*IoT7m equipment* includes a wide range of devices: leak detectors, temperature and motion sensors, relays, valves, smart sockets, heating controllers, meters, and other modules. These devices connect via various protocols:

- *Zigbee* – the primary standard for reliable low-power wireless communication;
- *Wi-Fi* – most commonly used in DIY devices based on *ESPHome* or *Tasmota*;
- *Z-Wave* – supported if needed, by prior arrangement.

Control is available via a mobile app, web interface, or *voice assistants such as Yandex Alice*, Google Assistant, and Siri. Using Alice, you can turn lights on and off, run scenarios ("Away", "Good Morning"), check device statuses, and much more.

This documentation will help you understand how to connect equipment, configure voice control, and manage the technical aspects of the system.
